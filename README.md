# Movie DB using 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Basic Requirements
Create a frontend application in React that allows a user to:
Search for movies
Render the results
Add movies to a playlist
Confirm the movies in the playlist.
Please include a footer that says "My favorite color is {your favorite color}" on the confirmation screen, with the background color being that color.


# Summary Questions
Please include answers to the following questions with your submission.
 What were the most difficult tasks?
    difficult part was to try completing the task in 4 hrs. As no design was provided I could spend long time just designing the page. I spent more time on making sure the code was function but didnt spend much time on styling. This is difficult for me being a front end engineer

2. Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?
    No
3. What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?
    I think I spent most of the time setting up redux and typescript. I could have just created a simple app without redux or typescript but it felt list the right way to go for an application that can be expanded to create shopping cart.
    I would also didnt get a chance to improve the style. All the css were very basic
   
5. How could the application be improved?
   1. add 'Load more' button at bottom of the main page to load more movies for the search term. Current Im only calling the default 10 movies. 
   2. add loading and error message in redux. This was a quick implementation
   3. adding ability to create users so we could also store playlist history per user.
